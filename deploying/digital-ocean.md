# Digital Ocean

If you don't already have a VPS or similar, I strongly recommend you to get a
Digital Ocean account. If you use the following link,
<https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a3eb2e3ed7ce>, you get $10 for your
account. Since the smallest droplet only costs $5/month you get 2 months of
VPS:ing for free. Destroying and creating a VPS is totally free, you are only
debited per hour your droplet is active. So it is a great way to play around
with and testing new technologies.
