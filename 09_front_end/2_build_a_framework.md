# Build a Framework

There are so many different ways of doing things with
JavaScript, it is difficul to decide what to do or what framework
to use.

Knowing what is needed is required to make informed decisions.

A good place to start is with no framework. Even when choosing
to go without framework, you still need to decide whether to use
small tools or build everything vanilla.

## Micro Libraries

Outdated, but interesting website <http://microjs.com/>

## 1. Templating

hyperscript & jsx

## 2. Routing

page.js

## 3. DOM Manipulation

Vanilla or dollr

## 4. Event Handling (not DOM)

[events](https://github.com/Gozala/events) (Node [events/EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) compatible module).
