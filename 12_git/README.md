# Git

Git is currently the most popoulat version control system in the world. It was
created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds when the Linux Kernel grew out of all
existing VCSs. It uses hashing (SHA1) on text-files to be able to compare
versions of the same file linewise. It then inserts or deletes lines as
needed,and keeps track of all users and different branches.

Working with more than one person on a project, version control systems change
everything. And Git is the best.
