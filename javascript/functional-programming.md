## The 2 Pillars of JavaScript

According to a certain 2 part blog series (and I agree completely), there are 2
pillars of JavaScript:

1. Objects without classes (and prototypal delegation aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects)
2. Lambdas (with closure — the keys to functional programming)

In order to fully understand the first pillar, I think said blog series falls
shorts. Instead, read the following 3 part article on only prototypal
delegation:

Then, read the following to better grasp Functional Programming.

1. [The Two Pillars of JavaScript, Part 2 (Functional Programming): How To Stop Micromanaging Everything](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4#.268j39loi)
2. [Wikipedia: Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

There is also a book published by O'Reilly, Functional JavaScript: Introducing
Functional Programming With Underscore.js (2013) that has gotten pretty good
reviews.
