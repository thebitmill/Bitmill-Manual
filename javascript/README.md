# JavaScript

To begin with, one should be able to play around with JavaScript in the browser
simply using script tags( `<script src=""></script>`).

JavaScript is indisputably THE (nowadays pretty awesome) programming language
of the web. Previously it was merely the (very quirky) programming language of
the browser. The advent of Node.js and NoSQL databases we have an entire web
development stack, purely in JavaScript.

The strengths of JavaScript are many. To name a few

1. It is extremely fast (thanks mainly to new, modern engines eg Google's V8)
2. It runs everywhere (server, browser, mobile, database, terminal...)
3. It has it's own layout language, CSS.
4. It has it's own data structuring language, JSON
5. It has it's own templating language, HTML (which are made further powerful with templating engines such as Dust)
6. It has several package & dependency managers, but one that trumps them all: NPM
7. There are soooo many awesome helper libraries it is insane (a non-exhaustive list is found at the bottom of this page)

## If you are an experienced programmer, a quick guide to JavaScript is the following:

1. JavaScript is loosely-typed, and variables are defined with the `var`
	 keyword. ES6/ES2015 introduces the `const` and `let` keywords.
2. Functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be saved to variables.
