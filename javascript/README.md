# JavaScript

To begin with, one should be able to play around with JavaScript in the browser
simply using script tags( `<script src=""></script>`).

## The 2 Pillars of JavaScript

According to a certain 2 part blog series (and I agree completely), there are 2
pillars of JavaScript:

1. Objects without classes (and prototypal delegation aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects)
2. Lambdas (with closure — the keys to functional programming)

## If you are an experienced programmer, a quick guide to JavaScript is the following:

1. JavaScript is loosely-typed, and variables are defined with the `var`
	 keyword. ES6/ES2015 introduces the `const` and `let` keywords.
2. Functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be saved to variables.
