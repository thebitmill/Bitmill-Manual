# Transition

One of the greatest additions to CSS3, is in my view, the transitions.
Sometimes it feelslike they make creating animated content so easy its like
cheating.

As usual, read the applicable chapters in

+ Oreilly "CSS3: The Missing Manual" (4th Edition)

There also resources on the web:

+ [CSS Animations Using Transitions](http://www.the-art-of-web.com/css/css-animation/#.Ul0akpzCQ1J)

TODO find more resources.
