# CSS & SASS

## CSS3 & Beyond

After CSS3 the stndard grew to be unwieldy and fit for one bundled spec.

Instead all different parts of CSS have been split into their own specifications.

So instead of releasing a future CSS4, there will be a [CSS Selectors Level
4](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/) for example.
