# Epiphany

Epiphany is basically an extension of Express. It sets up Express with the
standard settings, prewares etc that we use in virtually every website.
Epiphany is build around so called "loaders" that require an array of
directories to initialize models, middlewares, routes and templates. It's main
purpose is to allow creating reusable modules that can be located anywhere in
project directory structure. However, the code is not always pretty, and the
whole structure is beginning to be questioned. The README and Wiki are not up
to date.
