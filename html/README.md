## HTML5

HTML5 is the latest incarnation of the HTML specification. It is a combination
and continuation of both HTML4 and XHTML1.2. This means one can choose if one
would like to follow the stricter, fully XML compatibleness of XHTML or shoot
from the hip like HTML4.

HTML is language closely related to XML that structures data for websites. With
the advent of CSS essentially all visual aspects of web-development were
removed from HTML. If i ever see something like `<center>` or `<font>` i will
shoot whoever is responsible. If the shot is not fatal, and the perpitrator
repeats the sacrelege he will be put in a vaccuum chamber. Or an industrial
sized microwave.

Learning HTML5 is quite easy, but knowing only HTML5 will not get you very far.
