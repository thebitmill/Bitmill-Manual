Basically all realtime games, and even more graphically advanced turnbasedones
will be made using the awesome Canvas API. Certain javascriptlibraries like
Raphael.js use Canvas API to draw vectors.

SVG it is very easy to attach events to different objects, but animating large
SVG sections is painfully slow.
