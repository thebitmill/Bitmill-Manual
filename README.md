# TCB Guide

## Purpose of This Guide

The primary purpose of this guide is obviously to teach the tools we currently
use at the Code Bureau. A secondary purpose is to outline the core philosphies
behind TCB. Not only should one be able to see what we use, but also see how we think
and get an idea of what it's like to work with us.

## Never Ending Process

One of the most important concepts of this guide is the fact it will never be
complete.  As the tools we use, how we use them... and even what we do, is
constantly changing, so will this guide. Just like we try to apply Kaizen to
the code we write, we will apply the same philosophy to this guide.

## Enable Users to Contribute

verbose or in need of improvement, please do not hesitate to contribute.
