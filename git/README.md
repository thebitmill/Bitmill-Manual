# Git

Git är bäst. Tycker Tom. it's power and possibilites are nearly impossible to
overestimate. It is widely seen as the bestversion control system in the world.
Created in 2005 by Linux creator Linus Torvalds when the Linux Kernel grew out
of all existing VCSs.It uses hashing (SHA1) on text-files to be able to compare
versions of the same file linewise. It then inserts or deletes lines as
needed,and keeps track of all users and different branches.

Working with more than one person on a project, version control systems change
everything. And Git is the best.
